# RMTCAM
Streaming de cámara web TCP/IP

## Using it
First, my english is bad af.  

1. Start RMTCAM Viewer, put the prefered ip and port and then click on the Connect button. This will start the server, so Client can connect to it.  
2. In another computer (the one you want to see webcam) start RMTCAM Client with parameters. "`--ServerIP-localhost`" and "`--ServerPort-15243`" (by default).  
3. When the client connects, it will send the list of available cameras. You must select one and then click 'Open' button.  
4. Enjoy!. RMTCAM Viewer will start to show the another's computer webcam.
